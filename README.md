an optical character recognition system

hi kormasah this is a basic implementation, so i'm using just one endpoint ('/') to handle both image and document extraction, you can work with this now while we tweak as we move on.

okay so i had errors with the pdf part but i've fixed it now. i'm trying to see how containerizing the app will work as well thats why there's a docker file lol
